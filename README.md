# Capital Budgeting with Monte Carlo Simulation
Many times I look for capital budgeting templates with Monte Carlo simulations it will require me to use Excel with the add on.
Unfortunately, I neither have access to Windows nor do I plan on installing Excel on my Mac. I struggled to easily do this using
Google Sheets or Numbers on Mac. It may be possible to do, but the time dedication to figure this out would be too much when I
can simple build a template to use in Python.

## Usage
In the Python notebook, I lay out a scenario where a business is looking to move from an on premise cluster to cloud. In this example,
I use Google Cloud and Databricks cost. Please consult with your cloud vendor about any discounts to get accurate data points as well
as modifying the line items to represent your business.
